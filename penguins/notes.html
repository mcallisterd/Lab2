<h3>Why is Dr. Penguin wrong?</h3>
<p>Dr. Penguin will not actually be able to catch people who are cheating by looking at the correlation of their grades. The line 
showing correlation is showing the correlation of the two datasets together, as though they were part of one dataset. 
Therefore, this line will show whether both penguins collecitvely improved or regressed during the whole course.</p>

<h3>What could be right?</h3>
<p>Dr.Penguin should instead be looking to see how close the grade-points are for individual days between two penguins, or if any 
of the grade-points for two penguins are exactly the same for some day which would mean that two students got the same exact 
score. Then Dr. Penguin can look to see on how many days this occured for two penguins.</p>

<h3>How could this be shown?</h3>
<p>Perhaps Dr. Penguin should instead ask for a chart showing the difference in scores for individual days between two penguins. 
If the number were small, it would be more likely that cheating is occuring between the two penguins, and if the number were 
large, it would be less likely that either penguin was cheating. This could be done with a scatterplot of each penguin's grade 
data on the same chart as we have here, but instead of having a line showing the correlation of all the data, having a 
vertical line for each day connected to each of the grade-points of the penguins. This line could appear in blue or red to 
signify if the difference in scores is very low, or not concerning. If the grade-points were to be touching, the chart could 
have a thick red circle surrouding this day's grade-point, and possibly create a window alert to inform Dr. Penguin that there 
is at least one day in which the two chosen penguins scored the same. He can then look to see how many days this occured for 
these two penguins or how close all the other scores were between the two penguins and decide how to proceed from there.</p>
